    pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective
    of the
    offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to
    run the bases,
    having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The
    objective
    of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to
    prevent runners'
    advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in
    order
    and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores
    the most runs
    by the end of the game is the winner.`
